;;; LSP
;; Emacs comes with an integrated LSP client called `eglot', which offers basic LSP functionality.
;; However, `eglot' has limitations, such as not supporting multiple language servers
;; simultaneously within the same buffer (e.g., handling both TypeScript, Tailwind and ESLint
;; LSPs together in a React project). For this reason, the more mature and capable
;; `lsp-mode' is included as a third-party package, providing advanced IDE-like features
;; and better support for multiple language servers and configurations.
;;
;; NOTE: To install or reinstall an LSP server, use `M-x install-server RET`.
;;       As with other editors, LSP configurations can become complex. You may need to
;;       install or reinstall the server for your project due to version management quirks
;;       (e.g., asdf or nvm) or other issues.
;;       Fortunately, `lsp-mode` has a great resource site:
;;       https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/
